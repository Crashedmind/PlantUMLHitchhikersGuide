Having a diagram source as a text file is powerful because it allows for machine processing e.g.

#. If standard building blocks are used, it allows automated analysis and recognition of the diagram text source, and recommendations to the user e.g. 
   if an arrow text includes "TLS" to indicate the link is secured, then an external program can provide recommendations on TLS protocol version, cipher-suites etc...
#. As companies move towards standard architecture icon sets (AWS, MS/Azure, Google,...), it is possible to process an existing architecture diagram image with optical recognition (and machine learning) and create the text (plantuml) equivalent.

PlantUML_ is better known for UML-type diagrams (sequence, use case, state,...) and other non-UML diagrams (wireframes, mindmaps, gantt...)

* It has a simple intuitive syntax that makes it quick and easy to create/share/modify such diagrams.

PlantUMLStdlib_ is not so well known

* A simple intuitive syntax makes it quick and easy to create diagrams with icons.


Shared Lexicon of Understanding
===============================================================================

Such "*icon diagrams*" are increasingly popular as functionality moves up the stack and a standard set of off-the-shelf components becomes available ala Cloud, Everything-As-A-Service, Serverless.....

Companies like AWS, Google, Microsoft publish architecture icon sets for these building blocks for architecture diagrams:

#. https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/icons/
#. https://cloud.google.com/icons
#. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41937


These are the types of diagrams used for describing architectures as we see in :ref:`Create Real Life AWS Diagrams` where we recreate diagrams from the AWS architecture blog.

* These establish a shared lexicon of understanding and allow users to focus on the things they're trying to do.
* They can also be understood by a broad audience, especially the customer.
* They enable **lightweight just-enough** AgileModeling_ in a way that meets AgileModelingBP_ 


These building block icons can be used with 

#. architecture diagrams to give an overview of the building blocks and how  they are connnected
#. :ref:`c4-label` to give static views at different levels
#. sequence diagrams to give dynamic views at different levels


Interview with Arnaud Roques (creator of PlantUML)
===============================================================================

.. tip ::

    `A coffee with Arnaud Roques (creator of PlantUML) <https://modeling-languages.com/interview-plantuml/>`_ gives a good background to PlantUML from the man himself.

.. note ::

    Do you find yourself drawing similar diagrams with slight changes?

    Do you wish you could use a template that you, or someone else, created to make 
    it quicker and easier? And that you can build on over time?

    Here we'll create re-usable diagram templates using the PlantUMLPreProcessor_.
    We'll start with a diagram, then show how to make it into a template with customizable parts.

.. tip ::
    Did you know you can make your diagrams reusable to boost your productivity?

In this section, we'll take our existing Network Diagram and refactor it into a template...

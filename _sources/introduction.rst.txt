Goals
===============================================================================

#. Create a user-focused guide for PlantUML that enabled you, the user, to deliver maximum value with it.
#. Create a guide that was better than anything that existed and that I, @crashedmind, would be happy with.

Guide Principles
===============================================================================

The Principles on which this guide are based:

#. Learn by Playing: All examples include a link to allow you to edit and play with them easily - no setup required.
#. Open source - anyone can contribute to, or fork, this guide.
#. It must be fun to write it - and to read it.
#. To teach is to learn twice. If I knew all this info already, I would have no interest in writing this guide. There's no better way to learn than by writing a guide for others - and having the master on hand to provide insights as you go - and the community to share their knowledge. I expect to learn from feedback on this guide.
#. Documentation-Of-Code Documentation-As-Code: documentation of the examples, and the example source live together in the same directory in Git. 


About This Guide
===============================================================================

I, @crashedmind, wrote this guide as part of my own "Journey to Documentation as Code" where I landed on PlantUML and Sphinx as the main tools for proposing, analysing, documenting, maintaining software systems based on working with thousands of engineers across the globe.

I am a regular user of PlantUML and I believe in it.

I had initially contributed the OSA icon set to PlantUML Stdlib. Specifically I generated the icon set and published it in my github. I was pleasantly surprised that it was picked up and included in the PlantUML Stdlib.

Some time later I was working on a project that used an Elastic stack, and I needed the Elastic icon set for PlantUML. So I created that - and submitted via an email and PR.

I was thinking about adding more icon sets I needed, and trying to better understand the macros people had defined as part of their stdlib icon sets.
That's descibed in the chapter todo

So, I contacted Arnaud via email to see if anything like this was on the roadmap. 

I had the means and opportunity in my career to give something back.

Tools Used
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sphinx and PlantUML are the primary tools used for this guide.
The document (as HTML and images generated by Sphinx and PlantUML respectively) and the document source (as ReStructuredText, Plantuml source files) are hosted in Github.


Credits
===============================================================================

#. Arnaud for giving us PlantUML. And for being receptive and responsive; from my initial contact asking questions, to subsequent interactions providing suggestions.

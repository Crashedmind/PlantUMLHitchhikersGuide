Living Networked Information
ROI (Return on Investment) in information

Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users of the system (n²)
(http://www.mkbergman.com/837/the-law-of-linked-data/) 

Not all nodes/users will contribute the same value of information

The overall effort over time associated with maintaining information depends on the effort associated with creating and updating the information to keep it current and relevant
The ROI is proportional to (number of users) / (effort over time)
Networking data gives a significant increase in ROI by increasing the number of users and reducing the ongoing maintenance effort over time
"One circumstance of the enterprise is that data nodes are everywhere. The fact that the overwhelming majority are unconnected is why we have adopted the popular colloquialism of data “silos”. There are also massive amounts of unconnected data on the Web in the form of dynamic databases only accessible via search form, and isolated data tables and listings virtually everywhere.Thus, the essence of the semantic enterprise and the semantic Web is no more complicated than connecting — meaningfully — data nodes that already exist." 
 
"Documents" should be  living info in one place that should be updated by all at any time
#. **living info** documents, emails, meeting notes are point-to-point static snapshots of infofmation (spark of info that fades and dies)
like a fast way of posting a letter. social media (and how we should work) is a collaboration of information: less info more often by more people that we can build upon over time resulting in sustainable and growing information and documentation (fusion)
#. **in one place** can build upon existing info over time (standing on the shoulders of giants and all that...) 
#. **by all** everyone has something to contribute - else they wouldn't be on the project
#. ** at any time:** regularly provide incremental updates to a topic


Documentation is information that should be developed like code
e.g. multiple people contributing on different common parts and then integrating/re-using the result for different products (documents in this case)

and has similar pros and cons
allows the documentation to be writtten as we go 
people are much more likely to write a wiki page on something they are working on currently - rather than write a document at that time or some time later when they are no longer working on that thing
significantly reduces documentation effort and promotes information sharing
need to avoid information silos
multiple different living documents can be created by pulling in various pages as required
(using the include confluence content macro) as described above
a snapshot of the document can be done via export to word/pdf.
